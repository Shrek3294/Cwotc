1. Ok instead of the streamlit UI I want a java script react webpage that we will later tunnel into a cloudflare dns Look over the app.py to create a much more robust version in react

2. we need to implement a way to track/store properties from the report.json the goal would to catalouge a properties details put it in a database or something then when ever we run the script again if it finds new info on the house eg auction date, price we also should figure out a way to delete properties after they have been sold or are off auction.com
